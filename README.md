# 🌌 Project Kairos | Kai Digital Lab

**"Kairos" (Ancient Greek: καιρός):** represents a critical moment or a supreme opportunity. Unlike chronological time, it signifies a decisive gap in time where a fleeting opportunity must be seized with precision.

> **Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

## 🚀 Vision

**Project Kairos** is the official digital carrier for **Kai Digital Lab (K-LAB)**. It is not just a personal portfolio, but a technical manifestation of the philosophy **"Bridging Business & Technology."**

Designed for performance, built for scalability, and documented for clarity.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

This project adheres to a **Zero-Runtime Overhead** philosophy, leveraging modern web standards to achieve extreme performance.

* **Framework:** Astro 5.0+ - Utilizing Server-First architecture and View Transitions for a seamless SPA experience.

* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 - Next-generation CSS engine with Vite integration.

* **State Management:** Nano Stores - Framework-agnostic, lightweight (<1kb) state manager.

* **Interactivity: Vanilla Web Components** - Replacing heavy framework runtimes with native Custom Elements.

* **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare Pages with Zero Trust security protocols.

## 📐 Architectural Philosophy

As a **Senior Technical Program Manager**, I believe code should be as organized as a project roadmap:

* 1. **Clean Architecture:** Feature-based module separation and Atomic Design patterns.

* 2. **Zero-Dependency Interaction:** Using native `HTMLElement` and `<dialog>` to eliminate framework bloat.

* 3. **Strict Engineering Discipline:** Fully typed with TypeScript (Strict Mode) and documented through Conventional Commits.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

* [x] **Phase 1: Core Systems & Routing** - Astro I18n setup, Store refactoring (Nano Stores), and Layout architecture.
* [x] **Phase 2: Static Content** - Migration of Landing Page sections (Hero, Portfolio, etc.) to Astro Components.
* [x] **Phase 3: Dynamic Features** - Theme Explorer (Portfolio, E-Commerce, Corporate, Content, Software) & Floating Dock.
* [ ] **Phase 4: Optimization** - Final performance audit and Lighthouse certification.
