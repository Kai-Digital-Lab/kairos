# 🌌 Project Kairos | Kai Digital Lab

**"Kairos" (Ancient Greek: καιρός):** represents a critical moment or a supreme opportunity. Unlike chronological time, it signifies a decisive gap in time where a fleeting opportunity must be seized with precision.

> **Last Updated:** January 02, 2026

## 🚀 Vision

**Project Kairos** is the official digital carrier for **Kai Digital Lab (K-LAB)**. It is not just a personal portfolio, but a technical manifestation of the philosophy **"Bridging Business & Technology."**

Designed for performance, built for scalability, and documented for clarity.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

This project adheres to a **Zero-Runtime Overhead** philosophy, leveraging modern web standards to achieve extreme performance.

* **Framework:** Astro 5.0+ - Utilizing Server-First architecture and View Transitions for a seamless SPA experience.

* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 - Next-generation CSS engine with Vite integration.

* **Data Layer:** Astro Content Collections - Type-safe content management with Zod schemas.

* **State Management:** Nano Stores - Framework-agnostic, lightweight (<1kb) state manager.

* **Interactivity: Vanilla Web Components** - Replacing heavy framework runtimes with native Custom Elements.

* **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare Pages with Zero Trust security protocols.

## 📐 Architectural Philosophy

As a **Senior Technical Program Manager**, I believe code should be as organized as a project roadmap. This project follows the **"Gold Standard" Astro Architecture**:

* 1. **Domain-Driven Component Design:** Clear separation between `common` (UI atoms), `sections` (landing blocks), and `domain` (business logic) components.

* 2. **Type-Safe Data Flow:** All dynamic content is managed through strict Zod schemas in `src/content`, ensuring build-time integrity.

* 3. **Clean Layout Composition:** Hierarchical layout system separating SEO/HTML concerns (`BaseLayout`) from UI scaffolding (`PageLayout`).

## 🗺️ Roadmap

* [x] **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** - Astro I18n setup, Content Collections migration, and Schema definitions.
* [x] **Phase 2: Component Architecture** - Migration to Atomic Design (Common vs Domain components).
* [x] **Phase 3: Dynamic Features** - Theme Explorer with "Project Insanity" engine and Content Collection integration.
* [x] **Phase 4: Optimization & Cleanup** - Layout refactoring and removal of legacy debt.
